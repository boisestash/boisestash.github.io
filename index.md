## Saving Theater Arts Scavenger Hunt

Welcome to STASH Boise, a wild, raucous, socially-distanced scavenger hunt that raises funds for community theaters in Boise, Idaho. 

STASH -- Saving Theater Arts Scavenger Hunt -- is offering the chance to support local community theaters and have fun doing it! Rent, utilities and other expenses don’t stop for our local theaters just because the pandemic prevents them from putting on shows, so we’re creating a virtual scavenger hunt Oct. 23-25 as a fundraiser to help support Boise Little Theater, Stage Coach Theatre, and Treasure Valley Children’s Theater through these difficult times.

STASH offers the following:

- **Fun, and safe, challenges.** The STASH organizers are taking their cue from virtual scavenger hunts with items such as “design a haute couture face mask” or “draw a picture of a movie monster performing an ordinary household task.” Many of the challenges in STASH will be theater-themed, but you won’t have to be an actor, director or techie to do any of them. And all challenge items are designed to be done with ordinary household items and while practicing social distancing.

- **Prizes and bragging rights.** You and your team could achieve the coveted rank of “Broken Leg,” “Booth Rat,” or “Theater Ghost.” Teams with the most achievements as adjudicated by the organizers will win custom artwork.

- **Saving your favorite local community theater.** Community theaters in Boise have survived economic downturns, fires, and losing their homes. Now let’s help them survive COVID-19. STASH participants can select the theater or theaters they want their $15 registration fees to benefit.

Participants will need to register [here](https://stashboise.com/register). Tell your friends to register, too -- once you’re registered, you’ll be able to form into teams of 4-10 people by Oct. 19. STASH organizers will assist in combining unaffiliated participants or too-small teams into full-size teams. The list of scavenger hunt items will be posted on Friday, Oct. 23 during the 7 p.m. Opening Ceremonies Zoom call. Participants will have until noon on Sunday, Oct. 25 to complete as many challenges as possible and submit them by email to stashboise@gmail.com. All challenges will be able to be submitted as either jpegs, YouTube links, or brief text. 

Join the hunt to save community theater.
