## Saving Theatre Arts Scavenger Hunt

Welcome to STASH Boise, a wild, raucous, socially-distanced scavenger hunt that raises funds for community theaters in Boise, Idaho. 

Have you ever wanted to:
- meet a theater ghost?
- show off your dog's acting chops?
- raise money for your favorite local theaters while doing fun, creative activities?

Then keep an eye on this space! We'll be including all the info about when and how to participate, links for signup info, and, on the day of the hunt, the list of items you and your team will be scavenging for, for glory, prizes, fun, and to help save our local theaters in a time when these cherished local institutions are threatened by COVID-19.
