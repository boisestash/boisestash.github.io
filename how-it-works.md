# How STASH Works

* __Forming teams.__ 
	* You can form your team before or after registering, or with help from the STASH organizers. 
	* If you or members of your team register after you've come up with a team, include your team name on the registration form. 
	* If you come up with your team after registering, your team captain must email stashboise@gmail.com by Oct. 19 with the name of the team and the names of each team member. Please use the subject line "Team Formation."
	* Teams must have 4-10 members. If you register without a team or your team has fewer than 4 members, STASH organizers will combine participants into teams beginning Oct. 20.
	* Members of your household (children, pets, roommates, etc.) may assist you with completing items without being registered. However, they will not count toward the team size requirement unless they are registered.

* __Submitting items.__ 
	* All item submissions must be emailed to stashboise@gmail.com between the hunt hours of 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23, 2020, to noon Sunday, Oct. 25, 2020. 
	* Emailed submissions must contain the item number and the name of your team in the subject line. 
	* The list of items will be posted at [stashboise.com/list](https://stashboise.com/list) when the hunt begins.
	* Video items must be uploaded to youtube.com. Send the link to stashboise@gmail.com.
	* To submit a written item, paste the text into the body of the email. Do not send attachments.
	* Photo or drawn submissions must be sent as jpegs.
	* Coordinate with your team on which submissions you're tackling. If multiple submissions are made for the same item by the same team, STASH organizers will accept the last one that was sent to us by the deadline.
	* Some item descriptions may be ambiguous. Use your best judgment. The STASH organizers may not be able to answer all questions.
	* A few items are specifically listed as up to interpretation. Be creative. These items can be sent as a jpeg, YouTube link, or text.

* __Be safe.__
	* Don't do anything illegal.
	* Don't do anything physically dangerous to yourself or others.
	* Any items that you complete with the assistance of someone outside of your household or a household you quarantine with must be completed with social distancing and masks.
	* Have fun.
