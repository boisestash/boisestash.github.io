# The List

The October 2020 STASH hunt is complete! Watch this space and follow our social media at https://www.facebook.com/stashboise for updates on the next scavenger hunt.

<!--The list of scavenger hunt items will be posted here during the STASH Opening Ceremonies Zoom call, which will take place at 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23, 2020. -->

<!--It is not required for your team to do all of the items on this list. Don’t be silly! That would be impossible! _Or would it._ Seriously, it’s okay if the weekend hits, and you suddenly aren’t feeling as gung ho as when you signed up. It’s a freaking pandemic. We should all get extra credit just for getting out of bed. So do as many as you like, or as many as you are excited about.

Some items on this list are up to interpretation. Don’t freak out. 

Do not do anything illegal or unsafe when fulfilling these challenges. 

All submissions must be emailed to stashboise@gmail.com and contain the team name and challenge number in the subject line. All video challenges should be edited to under a minute unless otherwise specified, and should be posted to YouTube and the link sent in the body of the email. Photos should be submitted as jpegs. Drawing submissions can be created with digital art programs and saved directly as a jpeg and submitted, or you can take a photo or scan of a physical drawing (send as a jpeg). Text submissions should be submitted in the body of the email. 

Point values indicate the minimum points that may be awarded, but extra credit is arbitrary and awarded at the judges’ pleasure.
