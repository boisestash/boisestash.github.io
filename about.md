# About STASH

STASH -- short for Saving Theater Arts Scavenger Hunt -- was created in 2020 as a fundraiser for Boise-area community theaters that were hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 100% of the proceeds raised by the event will go to the beneficiary theaters (Boise Little Theater, Stage Coach Theatre, and Treasure Valley Children's Theater) designated by participants. STASH is organized by Helene Myers, Sarah Wright, Kim Sherman-Labrum, and Lora Volkert, and is based on the all-virtual [GISH](https://www.gish.com/) scavenger hunts held in 2020. 

STASH is designed to be a safe and fun event, and participants are expected to follow all applicable laws and safety guidelines (social distancing, masking, etc.) while performing the challenges. We're quite serious about you following safety guidelines. Do not make us use our stage manager voices.
